i support freedom of knowledge, i dont supoort closed OS and i miss the days when apple computers were good machines then the guy everyone cheered as a genius and a sage, but i support guys like steve wozniak and not assholes that if it was for him well, luckily jobs wasnt right, he tricked people with the easiest trick magicians use, tricking you that his fecal matter is better because is premium. 
SUPPORTING root, firmware modding, apple jailbreak, i support the malicious use of hacking, cracking, SE and the smart use of terms and conditions of certain brands to get free items, obtains refunds and trick the help center and show them the power of the will

do what thou wilt shall be a part of the law, 
be sacrilegious, embrace perversity, embrace bottom and active anal sex, bathe in cum and feast on blooded tampons

Worship cum and gay anal sex, walk on heels and enjoy the beautiful joy of holding people in your hand, make them a sweaty cock loving slut and then destroy the ties of the wedding, let the mens fornicate with mens and women with women

may the bukkake godz fill your whore anal cunt with their sacred seed and let the moonchild rise from the boundaries of depravity, give him the holy lancet and follow him on his mission, the final bloodbath, the san vito dance, the orgy of pain, blood and when half of the world population is dead, burn their flesh and give to pigs


from the deepest depths of freedom anc honesty a place rise from the ashes of Netscape navigator the software mecca, GITHUB

the prophet said the 7th day god was tired and amiga was born

Ave sprawl, let the insanity b3gin
